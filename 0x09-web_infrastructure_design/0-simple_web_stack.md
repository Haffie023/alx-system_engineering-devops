- **Server**: A server is a computer or system that provides resources, data, services, or programs to other computers, known as clients, over a network.

- **Domain Name**: The domain name serves as a human-friendly alias for an IP address. In this case, `foobar.com` is much easier to remember and type than `8.8.8.8`.

- **DNS Record**: The `www` in `www.foobar.com` is a type of DNS record known as a CNAME (Canonical Name). It allows you to alias one name to another.

- **Web Server**: The web server (Nginx in this case) accepts incoming requests and forwards them to the appropriate application server.

- **Application Server**: This is where your code runs. It processes incoming requests, interacts with the database if necessary, and constructs and sends back an HTML response.

- **Database**: The database (MySQL in this case) stores all persistent data for your application.

- **Communication Protocol**: The server communicates with the user's computer using HTTP/HTTPS protocol.

However, this infrastructure has some issues:

- **Single Point of Failure (SPOF)**: Since everything runs on a single server, if it goes down, your entire website goes down.

- **Downtime during Maintenance**: If you need to deploy new code or update your web server software, you'll likely need to restart your server, causing downtime.

- **Scalability Issues**: If your website receives more traffic than your server can handle, it will become slow or unresponsive. Since you only have one server, you can't easily scale up to meet increased demand.
